            <description><![CDATA[<p>Brainset is business that provides educational and therapeutic toys to niche markets in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Company is based in Dublin, Ireland and Glasgow, Scotland. It has shops/stores with attached storage facilities at both these locations. The company is very successful and is 90 years old, gross revenue for last year was €34.3 million. Between the two locations the company has 185 staff, 40 of these are part time seasonal staff. It’s expected that revenue will decrease by 15% per annum for the next three years. On foot of this, the new managing director wants to reinvent the business, so that it can fully operate online – to minimise any loses in revenue. Lochan business solutions were contacted to see if we could advise them in undertaking this full transition.</p>]]></description>
